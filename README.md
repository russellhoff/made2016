The Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable is not intended:

* As a general replacement for Jet (If you need a general replacement for Jet you should use SQL Server Express Edition).
* As a replacement for the Jet OLEDB Provider in server-side applications.
* As a general word processing, spreadsheet or database management system -To be used as a way to create files. (You can use Microsoft Office or Office automation to create the files that Microsoft Office supports.)
* To be used by a system service or server-side program where the code will run under a system account, or will deal with multiple users identities concurrently, or is highly reentrant and expects stateless behavior.
